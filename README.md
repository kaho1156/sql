To showcase the sql query, I have selected my tasks done in leetcode (for details, can refer to the attached documents):

Q1. 

SQL Schema
Table: Employee

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| id | name  | salary | managerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | Null      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | Null      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
Output: 
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+

*** My solution:

SELECT e.name as Employee
FROM employee AS e INNER JOIN employee AS e1 ON e.managerId = e1.id
where e.salary > e1.salary
